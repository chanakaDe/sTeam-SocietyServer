### The Project

 The web site , sTeam collaboration platform is a blogging site mostly like Custom WordPress blogging site. Users can login to the system , can compose posts , publish them and view other posts added by other users. This is the main thing we do in WordPress Blog. We can publish what ever we want because its a simple and creative system. We can share images , videos , etc. Those who haven't permission to login , cannot add new posts. They can view posts. And also, there can be a special feature like custom view permissions. Users can publish posts only to appear those who are logged in. Its a special and extra feature beyond the specification. And also users can add new posts and draft them. So they can edit them later and publish the posts later. Its also a new feature. And also system user privileges have to be managed in a proper way. And also route management. And also all the administrative tasks , like add new post , remove posts and edit all posts are only available to logged in users. And it can be managed in two levels. Logged in normal users with less administrative privileges and logged in users with all the administrative privileges.
